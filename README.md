Alike dating app harnesses the technology of blockchain to realise the dream of trust between parties when doing transaction. 

In this python script that was taken and edited from Aptos' tutorial, it demostrates the ability to create addresses for 2 different parties, query the balances that are available in each addresses and execute a transfer of tokens from one address to another. Alike would utilise the ease of account creation and transfer of tokens of the Aptos network to enable Alike users to transact easily, securely, and privately. 

In the future, we would improve upon the service and allow users to send the encrypted information over the Aptos chain that the public is able to see and verify on the Aptos chain.
